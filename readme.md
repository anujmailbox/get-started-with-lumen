# [Get Started With Lumen][published url]
## Instructor: [Simon Bacquie][instructor url]

Lumen is the fast new PHP micro-framework from the Laravel project. It allows you to use the power of Laravel, including the Eloquent ORM and features such as routing, middleware and validation, with the flexibility and low overhead of a micro-framework. If you like Laravel, or just want to use a cutting-edge server-side platform for writing microservices and REST APIs, Lumen is a great choice.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Simon Bacquie will help you get started coding with Lumen. You'll start with a blank, boilerplate Lumen app, and build it out into a full web app that manages books and authors. Along the way you'll learn about some of the key Lumen features, such as Eloquent, routing, controllers and more!
